Be aware that jobs scheduled during daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will
not be run!

Thread safety

Since the Cron service runs concurrently with the calling code, some amount of
care must be taken to ensure proper synchronization.

All cron methods are designed to be correctly synchronized as long as the caller
ensures that invocations have a clear happens-before ordering between them.

Implementation

Cron entries are stored in an array, sorted by their next activation time.  Cron
sleeps until the next job is due to be run.

Upon waking:
 - it runs each entry that is active on that second
 - it calculates the next run times for the jobs that were run
 - it re-sorts the array of entries by next activation time.
 - it goes to sleep until the soonest job.
